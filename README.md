# Draupr

This is a project started by Nathan Foster and Kenneth Diehl to learn new and practice old skills in the field of web development. This site is still very early in development and will continue to be built upon through the years. At this time, we are unsure whether we will release Draupr to the open web. However, feel free to take a look around and even create a temporary account. Don't forget to give us any feedback you have, we would love to hear from you.
